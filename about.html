      <h3>What is this Thing Anyways?</h3>
      <p>
        It is first and foremost a translation website.
        It is currently under construction as a final project for 
        my German 472 class at the University of Michigan. If I like
        how it turns out, I might continue to develop it!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm choosing to call it a "linked-dynamic" translation, because
        it uses HTML and Javascript to link poetry and commentary and
        make the actual text of the poems dynamic. (There's some CSS
        to make it pretty, too, or at least marginally better than 
        plaintext). 
      </p>
      <h3>What's so Interesting About It?</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to explore a new way of translating. 
        Good translation should stand on its own as
        a work of art. It should 
        <q>awake an echo of the original,</q><sup><a 
          href="#Benjamin">1</a></sup>  
        which is to say that it needs to remain connected in an almost resonant way
        with the source work, but also function on its own terms
        in the target language. Translation cannot
        ignore its role as commentary on the original work
        and on the process of translation itself. Like all art, it thrives on the creation and
        presentation of context, in that context gives it meaning, with each work then becoming
        part of the context. 
        Translating, then, relies
        on an economy of language and information: 
        too little, and the work becomes either cryptic – an
        exercise in "translation-ese" – or disconnected from the
        original; too much, and the translation is bogged down,
        broken up, and becomes merely commentary and disassembly
        of the original. One of the main difficulties in translation is the
        struggle to find and maintain a consistent approach, one that
        respects the economy of language and uses it to create
        and connect. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The nature of language is such that
        <q><span id="0" class="linky">no word</span>
          <span id="1"class="linky">in one</span>
          <span id="2"class="linky">language</span>
          <span id="3"class="linky">is totally</span>
          <span id="4"class="linky">equal</span>
          <span id="5"class="linky">to one</span>
          <span id="6"class="linky">in another</span>.</q><sup><a href="#Humboldt">2</a></sup>
        (Take a closer look at this quote). There are many different ways to translate, and the resulting
        translations will have different syntax, semantics, and meaning in the target language.
        The trick is then to choose the translation which will create and connect context –
        this relates directly to Schleiermacher's concept of whether to "move the reader" 
        or "move the writer,"<sup><a href="#Schleiermacher">3</a></sup> but is not necessarily
        bound to either option. 
        With the dynamic translation techniques that this project is trying to develop,
        these differences between translations are highlighted, the ability to give context to
        the reader is increased, and everything is incorporated into a single
        work which can still stand alone as a work of art.
      </p>
      <p>
        The danger in all of this
        is still that the translation could be bogged down by an overabundance of 
        information. Therefore, it is vital that we take advantage of <em>how</em>
        the work and its context can be presented, and the ways in which language can be used that
        were not previously possible.
        It is with this in mind that I decided
        to keep the dynamic links initially hidden in the poems and give the reader the ability
        to hide the commentary. The work needs to stand on its own, and the reader needs
        to have some control over the information which is presented to them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With the internet, we have a new medium and new rules.
        We have, in effect, a new
        economy of language and information, one that lends itself
        well to the process and product of translation. 
      </p>
