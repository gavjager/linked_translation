      <h3>What is this Thing Anyways?</h3>
      <p>
        It is first and foremost a translation website.
        It is currently under construction as a final project for 
        my German 472 class at the University of Michigan. If I like
        how it turns out, I might continue to develop it!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm choosing to call it a "linked-dynamic" translation, because
        it uses HTML and Javascript to link poetry and commentary and
        make the actual text of the poems dynamic. (There's some CSS
        to make it pretty, too, or at least marginally better than 
        plaintext). 
      </p>
      <h3>What's so Interesting About It?</h3>
      <p>
        The goal is to explore a new way of translating. 
        Good translation should stand on its own as
        a work of art. It should 
        <q>awake an echo of the original,</q><sup><a 
          href="#Benjamin">1</a></sup>  
        and function on its own terms
        in the target language. Translation also cannot
        escape its role as commentary on the original work
        and on the process of translation itself.
        Performing this task artfully relies
        on an economy of language and information: 
        too little, and the work becomes either cryptic – an
        exercise in "translation-ese" – or disconnected from the
        original; too much, and the translation is bogged down,
        broken up, and becomes merely commentary and disassembly
        of the original.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the internet, we have a new medium, and new rules.
        Information is more accesible, and can be
        presented in new ways. Language can be used in ways that 
        were not previously possible. We have, in effect, a new
        economy of language and information, one that lends itself
        well to the process and product of translation.
