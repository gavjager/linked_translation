Winter-answer
Ilse Aichinger

The fabric of the world,
it demands to be considered:
no more eyes
to gaze upon white meadows,
no ears, which in the boughs
can hear the stirring of birds.
Grandmother, where are your lips gone,
to taste the sweet grasses,
and who smells the sky for us,
whose cheeks are scratched
still sore on the walls of the village?
Is it not a dark forest
we're getting ourselves into?
No, Grandmother, it is not dark,
I know it, I lived a while
with the children on its edge,
and it is not even a forest.
