Winter-answer

["The fabric of the world,
it demands to be considered:",
"The world is made of such stuff,
which requires contemplation:",
"The world is made of such stuff;
take it all in:"]
["no more eyes",
"no eyes anymore",
"we lack the eyes"]
with which to see the white meadows,
no ears, which in the boughs
can hear the ["stirring", "whirring"] of birds.
Grandmother, where are your lips gone,
["to taste the sweet grasses,",
"with which to savor the grasses,"]
and who smells for us the sky to its end,
whose cheeks rub themselves today
still sore on the walls of the village?
Is it not a dark forest
we're getting ourselves into?
No, Grandmother, it is not dark,
I know it, I lived a while
with the children on its edge,
and it is not even a forest.

The world is made of such stuff,
which requires contemplation:
no eyes anymore,
in order to see the white meadows,
no ears, in order to hear
in the boughs the stirring of birds.
Grandmother, to whence are your lips,

Die Welt ist aus dem Stoff,
der Betrachtung verlangt:
keine Augen mehr,
um die weißen Wiesen zu sehen,
keine Ohren, um im Geäst
das Schwirren der Vögel zu hören.
Großmutter, wo sind deine Lippen hin,
um die Gräser zu schmecken,
und wer riecht uns den Himmel zu Ende,
wessen Wangen reiben sich heute
noch wund an den Mauern im Dorf?
Ist es nicht ein finsterer Wald,
in den wir gerieten?
Nein, Großmutter, er ist nicht finster,
ich weiß es, ich wohnte lang
bei den Kindern am Rande,
und es ist auch kein Wald.

The world is made of such stuff;
take it all in:
we lack the eyes,
to see the white meadows,
the ears, which in the boughs
can hear the whirring of birds.
Grandmother, where are your lips,
to savor the grasses,
and who smells for us the sky, the whole,
whose cheeks are now rubbed raw,
still sore on the walls of the village?
Isn't it dark, this woods
we're getting ourselves into?
No, Grandmother, it's not dark,
I know it, I lived a while
with the children on the edge,
and it is not even a woods.
