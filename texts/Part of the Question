Part of the Question
Ilse Aichinger

High on the platform stands the pool of water,
the air seems to rise up in bulbs,
and what they are singing
leaves no more impression on me.
The fish circle round the church doors,
who will answer me:
Shall I away to the mountain,
or to the house with those
who love me,
and the broad view,
the crunch of every step,
once more?
Oh how my land is turning black,
only deep below,
time bends greenly.
