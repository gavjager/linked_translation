'<h3>Translating "Winter-Answer"</h3>' +
"<p>" +
"Winter-answer is a poem of the senses and perception. The title is an example of " +
"a German compound word, one which in this case does not lend itself to an obvious interpretation " +
"even with the context of the poem. It is clear that the poem is advocating for a return " +
"to some other mode of perception, one which even the grandmother in the poem has forgotten. " +
"Perhaps it can be seen in the light of the sense-dullness and isolation of winter, in which " +
'the sky is darker for longer, the birds have migrated, and there is no "grass to taste." ' +
'With this in mind, "Winterantwort" can be seen as an answer to the numbness of winter, ' +
'even as this "answer" is being sought out in the "finsterer Wald" – the dark, presumably wintry woods. ' + 
'Here we find a thematic parallel to the "bleak/bright" dynamic present in <a href="winter-early.html">"Winter-early."</a> ' +
'The symbolism of the "Wald" is very important. Usually translated as forest, I decided to go with "woods" throughout. '  +
'It can be seen as representing the unknown; it has dark and mysterious properties, and is ' +
'not what it initially seems to be in the poem. I believe "woods" possesses some of the same mysterious connotations, ' +
'unlike "forest," which seems more geographical. This idea of venturing out into the unknown, ' +
'following the children who have grown up on the edge of some new mode of perception, some new paradigm or era – ' +
'this idea is central to many of the poems in this collection. ' +
'Aichinger advocates for societal change throughout, which is not surprising given her involvment in ' +
'<a href="aichinger-v_r.html">Gruppe 47.</a>' +
"</p>";

var weltstoff =
'<h3>Considering the fabric of the world</h3>' +
"<p>" +
'Because of the structure of the first two lines in German, as well as the differences in mode of possible expression compared ' +
'to English, the beginning of this poem was very difficult to translate. The word "Stoff," while it has a clear ' +
'etymylogical link to "stuff" in English, has a wider breadth of meaning and usage which does not match up with the ' +
'usually informal connotation of "stuff." I did, however, use it in two of the alternate translations, hoping to evoke an ' +
'echo of Shakespeare\'s: "we are such stuff as dreams are made of," which which is closer to the usage here. ' +
'However, outside of a dynamic translation, I would have likely chosen "fabric" or "nature of the world." ' +
'The word "Betrachtung" in the German, which also has a wide breadth of meaning, encapsulating "contemplation," ' +
'"consideration," "discourse," and elements of "examination," was another obvious choice for a dynamic element in the poem. ' +
'With the multiple variants here, I tried to convey a sense of both the importance of perception, and the ' +
'idea of "mulling things over."' +
"</p>";

var augen_und_ohren =
'<h3>Eyes and Ears</h3>' +
"<p>" +
'The sense that the original poem conveys here is one of purpose. It is clear of the eyes and ears mentioned ' +
'that they were "eyes in order to see," and "ears in order to hear," not just that they could potentially be used ' +
'to look at fields and hear birds. I tried to give the translation that same sense by emphasizing the "lack" ' +
'of each, or using the construction "eyes with which to see," instead of simply "eyes to see." ' +
"</p>";

var keine_augen_mehr = 
'<h3>Physical and Temporal</h3>' +
"<p>" +
'I thought this would be an interesting place to show this type of translation\'s potential ' +
'for emphasizing different aspects of meaning. The original German corresponding to this element ' +
'conveys the sense of both a personal loss of the senses and a general societal loss of the senses over time. ' +
'While the English "no more eyes," probably does this sufficiently well, I thought it would be interesting to ' +
'include both variants to highlight this distinction.' +
"</p>";

var schmecken = 
'<h3>A German Verb</h3>' +
"<p>" +
'The German verb "schmecken" – to taste, is a very interesting one, in that it has positive connotations as a default. ' +
'When something tastes good in German, the phrase is "das schmeckt mir" – "that tastes to me." And while the appeal of ' +
'eating grasses is somewhat limited in the general, non-bovine population, there is a positive association built into ' +
'the language of the original poem which I thought was important to carry over.' +
"</p>";

var himmel_zu_ende = 
'<h3>An Intricate Phrase</h3>' +
"<p>" +
'On first reading, I was not certain I had understood this correctly. The line is "und wer riecht uns den Himmel zu Ende," ' +
'literally: "and who smells us the sky to end." The German grammar helps this to make more sense, but ' + 
'finding an English representation for the weirdness and completeness and potential freedom contained here was no easy task. ' +
'I tried to pick variants which represented these ideas in their structure and wording.' +
"</p>";

var finsterer_wald = 
'<h3>A Dark Woods</h3>' +
"<p>" +
'Given the symbolism of "the woods" in this poem, it seems a good place to build in some alternate intepretations. ' +
'The first variant, "Isn\'t it dark..." fits much better into the overall tone of the poem, and sounds as if a ' +
'grandmother were actually saying it, while "Is it not a dark woods..." evokes a ghost-story type of mood, right on ' +
'the edge of of "It was a dark and stormy night." Both readings contribute to developing the tone of the poem in different, ' +
'but equally important ways.' +
"</p>";

var am_rande = 
'<h3>On the Edge of the Woods</h3>' +
"<p>" +
'The literal translation of the German here is "on the edge," but the nature of the language is such that it could also be ' +
'translated as "on its edge." German often substitutes possessive pronouns with an article, and it is understood implicitly ' +
'in a similar way that an English phrase would be understood with a possessive pronoun. However, the poem is clearly ' +
'addressing something larger than simply the edge of a forest. Therefore, it seemed that the generality of "the" would also ' +
'be appropriate to the situation.' +
"</p>";
