      <h2>How to Use This Website</h2>
      <p>
        Clicking on the links below or in the navigation bar above will
        bring up a new page with a translated poem in the left column
        and translator's commentary in the right. 
        Each poem in this collection contains links which are initially 
        invisible. To view them, you can either find them with your
        cursor (they will highlight blue) or press the "Reveal Links
        in Poem" button at the bottom of each page. Clicking the poem
        links will change the translation itself.
        This makes each poem dynamic,
        and gives the translator the ability to work within the bounds
        of the target language without being as confined to them
        as on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking the poem links will also bring up commentary
        corresponding to the change, which will be displayed in the
        right-hand column.
        You also have the option to bring up the original German version
        (the smaller link at the bottom of the poem) or, by clicking
        on the title, to return to the general commentary on the 
        translation. The right-hand column, which tends to be
        distracting at times, can be hidden with the
        "Hide/Show Commentary" button at the bottom of the page.
