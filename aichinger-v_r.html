      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <img src=>
      <p>
        Ilse Aichinger was born in Vienna, Austria in 1921 along with her twin sister Helga. 
        Her mother was a doctor of Jewish ancestry, and her father was a teacher. 
        The family moved to Linz, but Ilse and Helga moved back to Vienna with their mother after 
        the separation of their parents in 1926. After years of political instability, 
        the Nazis took power during the Anschluss of Austria in 1938. In the following years, 
        Ilse was forced to drop out of school, her mother lost her job, and her grandmother, 
        aunt and uncle were murdered in a death camp. Helga successfully fled to England in 1939, 
        but Ilse and her mother were unable to emigrate. After being assigned a room opposite a 
        Gestapo headquarters to work as a slave-laborer, Ilse was fortunately able to hide her mother 
        until the end of the war. After the war in Europe had ended, Ilse resumed her studies and 
        became a medical student, during which time she began writing and publishing essays. 
        Eventually dropping out of the medical course to focus on her writing, she was the first 
        Austrian to write about concentration and death camps with the text “Das Vierte Tor” [The Fourth Gate],
        published in 1945. Her only novel, Die grössere Hoffnung [The Greater Hope], a surrealist story of 
        Nazi persecution from a child’s perspective, was completed in 1948. Her short story 
        “Spiegelgeschichte” would later garner the attention of Gruppe 47 [Group 47], a group of 
        writers who were trying to spread democratic ideas in Austria in the wake of the second world war. 
        She would later become a member and win the group’s 1952 prize for “Spiegelgeschichte”. 
        The following year she married another member of Gruppe 47, Günter Eich. She developed pieces for 
        radio for a short time before going on to teach at the Academy of Arts Berlin, and the University of 
        Vienna, also publishing collections of short stories such as Wo ich wohne [Where I Live]. 
        After the death of her husband in 1972, Aichinger published less and less; her writing did not 
        recover until the 1990’s. Once writing again, however, Aichinger continued to publish and to win 
        prizes for her writing well into the 2000’s. She died in Vienna on November 11, 2016.
